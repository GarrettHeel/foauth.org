foauth.org
==========

Making OAuth optional.

Implementation
--------------

TBD.

I'd love to see it be 100% an API. Users can register new apps

Perhaps it would ship with an 'foauth-client' module that wraps requests that allows usersto hit any fo the registered sites *super* easily.




* Flask + SQLAlchemy
* Heroku
* Ideally, Requests+idan's module.
