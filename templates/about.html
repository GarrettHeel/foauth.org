					<h1>About foauth.org</h1>

						<p>The idea for foauth.org came out of conversation between a couple of people who were frustrated with having to fight with OAuth in order get to our own data on our favorite services. It made sense for those services to talk to each other with OAuth, but for us to write our own scripts, we were required to either register our own app with a website and everything or restrict ourselves to the few services that offer a friendlier alternative.</p>
						<p>HTTP already has its own authentication system, and there are hundreds &mdash; perhaps thousands &mdash; of tools that know how to work with it. Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to use that in our own scripts, but have something communicate with the services using OAuth behind the scenes? Thus, foauth.org was born.</p>
						<p>Rather than try to build a bunch of bells and whistles and make everything really complicated, we focused on just one task: taking OAuth out of the equation when accessing your own data. Our goal is to help you log in with OAuth-compliant services using HTTP Basic authentication. That's it.</p>
						<p>foauth.org was originally created by <a href="https://github.com/gulopine">Marty Alchin</a>, but in December 2014 became a part of <a href="https://www.runscope.com/community?utm_source=partner&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=foauth">Runscope's Community Projects</a>.</p>
